# Overview

Frankt is a small package that allows you to run client side actions from your [Phoenix Framework][1] project.

## How does it work?

Contrary to other solutions Frankt only provides a thin layer over Phoenix channels. If you already know how Phoenix channels work, there are no new concpets to learn. **You can use your existing code**, you have access to your templates, business logic and any other resource of your application.

For more detailed information and some examples take a look at the `Frankt` module docs and the guides.
